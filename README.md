# Munajjam مُنَجِّم

> A Python library to synchronize Quran Ayat with audio recitations

This project automatically synchronizes Quranic verses (ayahs) with recitation audio by generating accurate timestamps for the start and end of each ayah.

## 🚀 Roadmap

We're working on **Munajjam v2.0** — a complete rewrite as a professional Python library!

📋 **[View the v2.0 Roadmap](plan.md)** — See what we're building and how you can contribute.

Key goals:
- 📦 Installable Python package (`pip install munajjam`)
- 🔌 Clean API for integration into other projects
- ⚡ Async support for batch processing
- 🪝 Hooks system for monitoring and telemetry
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
